### Cocktail list

Note this tool isn't currently meant to be a complete list of all the cocktails one might want to make, it is just a sampling of a few different common cocktails using a variety of drinkware, ingredients, garnishes, and serving methods. As such, don't expect to be able to find *any* cocktail in here, but you can expect to find some of the more well-known ones.
